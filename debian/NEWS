  * If using RADIUS auth with the MSCHAP protocol and OpenSSL 3, you will need
    to enable the OpenSSL legacy provider. This happens because MSCHAP relies
    on DES, which has been relegated to the legacy provider in OpenSSL 3.
    See https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/OpenSSL_3.0#Providers for further
    informarion.
